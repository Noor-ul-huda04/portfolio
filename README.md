 Portfolio Website

This is my first professional website, built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It showcases my education, projects, and experiences in a clean, responsive layout.  
Designed for clarity and usability, it provides a quick overview of my skills and work.  
Perfect for sharing my portfolio with potential employers or collaborators.
